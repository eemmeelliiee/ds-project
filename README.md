# ds-project-2
## Instructions:
Clone the repo. The dataset is included in folder ```data``` and thus does not need to be downloaded.

```data-preparation.py``` cleans the original dataset and outputs ```cleaned_dataset.csv```, which is later used for the predictive modeling in ```data-modeling-and-model-evaluation.py```.
